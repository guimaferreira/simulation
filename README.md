# Universe Simulation Project

## Concept

This project aims to simulate a universe starting from a Big Bang event, focusing on the evolution of a central particle that could potentially form a planet and foster life. The simulation will be 3D and will run in a web browser using Three.js for visualization and Cannon.js for physics.

## Structure

The project will be organized into modular components, separating the concerns of physics, rendering, and user interface, making the codebase maintainable and extensible.

```

## Development

When developing the simulation:

- Use /src/core for the main simulation logic.
- Implement the physics in /src/physics with Cannon.js as the physics engine.
- Build the 3D visualization with Three.js in /src/render.
- Add user interaction capabilities within /src/ui.
- Utilize /src/utils for shared utility functions and constants.

## Setup

To get started with the Universe Simulation project, follow these setup instructions:

1. Ensure you have Node.js installed. If not, download and install it from nodejs.org.

2. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/universe-simulation.git
cd universe-simulation
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

To start the development server and watch for changes, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the simulation.
